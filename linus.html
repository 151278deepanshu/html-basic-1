        Linus Benedict Torvalds (born 28 December 1969) is a Finnish-American computer programmer, best known as the creator of the Linux kernel. 
        He also created the version control system Git.He studied computer science  at the University of Helsinki,and he developed the Linux kernel as a student project in 1991.
        Since then, the Linux kernel has become one of the most widely used kernels in the world , powering everything from smartphones to supercomputers

                The development of Linux
            </u>
            
        </h2>
        <p>
            Exposure to the powerful processors and stable Unix operating system of Helsinki University computers inspired Linus Torvalds to take the leap of developing his own operating system. During the later part of his studies, he got a PC with a 33MHz Intel 386 processor and 4MB of memory, a huge amount at the time. Though the capabilities of the computer impressed him, he found the MS-DOS operating system disappointing. 
            He started developing the operating system that became Linux because he could not get a copy of the Unix OS for his computer to replace MS-DOS. Torvalds wanted an OS that could take full advantage of the 386 processor. He tried to use a copy of Minix he procured through academic contacts. This also did not meet his needs as it was not fully open-source.

        </h2>
        <p>
            Linus Torvalds decided to write his own operating system for his computer. This was a massive undertaking but it made a massive and edifying contribution to contemporary computing. The operating system was based on Unix and Minix, but development work was so involved that he took time off his academic studies to work on Linux full-time. By the 25th of August 1991, he had completed an initial version of the OS, which he shared with the Minix newsgroup. 
            By September 1991, Torvalds had completed the 0.01 version of the Linux operating system. The first official version, 0.02, was released a month later. The OS could run the text-only user interface for Unix-like systems called the bash shell and the GNU C Compiler. It was at this point that he shared the OS as a collaborative venture, messaging other developers via Minix.

        <h3>
           <u>
            Why Linux?
           </u> 
        </h3>
        <p>Torvalds used the name Linux as a contraction of Linus’ Minix. This was the working name of the operating system. Linus Torvalds did not intend Linux to be the long-term name of the OS.
        His friend Ari Lemmke, an FTP service administrator, encouraged him to share his source code more widely so that other programmers could study and refine it. Ari created a directory for the OS on his FTP server called “Linux” rather than the name FreaX that Torvalds had intended, and the name clearly stuck. </p>

    </h3>
    <ul>
         <li><b>1991-94 -</b> I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones</li>
         <li><b>1995-95</b> When you say, "I wrote a program that crashed Windows," people just stare at you blankly and say, "Hey, I got those with the system, for free."</li>
         <li><b>2000-04</b> Note that nobody reads every post in linux-kernel. In fact, nobody who expects to have time left over to actually do any real kernel work will read even half. Except Alan Cox, but he's actually not human, but about a thousand gnomes working in under-ground caves in Swansea. None of the individual gnomes read all the postings either, they just work together really well.</li>
